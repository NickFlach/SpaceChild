## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
node >= 18.0.0
npm >= 9.0.0
git >= 2.30.0

# Optional but recommended
docker >= 20.0.0
```

### Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spacechild.git
cd spacechild

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/spacechild/spacechild.git
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Initialize consciousness engine
npm run consciousness:init

# Run tests to verify setup
npm test
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add consciousness feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### TypeScript Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Provide type definitions for all exports
- Document complex types with JSDoc
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
feat: Add new consciousness metric
fix: Resolve agent synchronization bug
docs: Update API documentation
test: Add forecasting engine tests
refactor: Improve consciousness processing
perf: Optimize quantum gating
```

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Minimum 80% code coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- consciousness

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```
