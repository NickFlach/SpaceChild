## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
