# 🚀 Quick Fix - Port Already in Use

## The Problem
Port 5000 is already in use by another process.

## ✅ Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Start Script (Recommended)
```bash
.\start-dev.bat
```
This script will:
- Kill any existing node processes
- Wait 2 seconds
- Start the dev server fresh

### Option 2: Manual Fix

**Step 1 - Kill the process:**
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

**Step 2 - Wait a moment, then start:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Use a Different Port

Edit `.env` file and change:
```env
PORT=3000
```

Then restart the server.

## 🎯 What to Do Next

After running the fix:

1. ✅ Server should start successfully
2. ✅ Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or your chosen port)
3. ✅ Your SpaceChild platform should load!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see the error:

**Find what's using port 5000:**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```

**Kill specific process by PID:**
```powershell
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

### If build is needed for production:

**Build first:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Wait for completion, then:**
```bash
npm start
```

## 💡 Development vs Production

**For Development (recommended while coding):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
- No build needed
- Hot reload
- Fast changes

**For Production:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
- Optimized bundles
- Better performance
- Requires build step

## 🌟 Your App Is Ready!

Once the server starts, you'll see:
```
🌟 Server running on port 5000
🧠 Consciousness-powered platform ready!
```
