## Getting Started

### Starting a Multi-Agent Session

1. **Navigate to Multi-Agent Panel** in your project
2. **Enter your goal** in natural language:
   ```
   Create a responsive dashboard with user authentication and real-time data updates
   ```
3. **Click "Start Collaboration"** to begin

### Monitoring Progress

The system provides real-time monitoring through six tabs:

- **Overview** - High-level progress and metrics
- **Agents** - Individual agent status and current tasks
- **Tasks** - Detailed task breakdown and completion status
- **Messages** - Inter-agent communication log
- **Intelligence** - Knowledge insights and conflict resolution
- **Live Code** - Real-time collaborative coding streams

5. **Notifies all participants**

### Knowledge Sharing

Agents build a shared knowledge graph:
- **Semantic similarity** connections (>0.7 threshold)
- **Cross-pollination** of expertise
- **Learning acceleration** through shared insights
- **Pattern recognition** across projects

### Real-time Collaboration

#### Live Code Streams
- **Concurrent editing** with operational transform
- **Real-time analysis** with 1-second debouncing
- **Agent-specific suggestions** during collaboration
- **Conflict-free merging** of simultaneous changes

#### Operational Transform
- **Position-based transforms** for insert/delete/replace operations
- **Timestamp ordering** for conflict resolution
- **Automatic synchronization** across all participants

## API Reference

### Starting Collaboration
```typescript
POST /api/multiagent/start
{
