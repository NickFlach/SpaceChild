# AI Agents in SpaceChild

SpaceChild features a powerful multi-agent system that assists with various aspects of software development. This guide explains how to work with these AI agents.

## Available Agents

### 1. Orchestrator
- **Role**: Coordinates between different agents
- **Capabilities**: Task delegation, progress tracking, conflict resolution
- **When to use**: For complex projects requiring multiple agents

### 2. Frontend Expert
- **Role**: Specializes in UI/UX development
- **Capabilities**: React components, styling, responsive design
- **When to use**: Building user interfaces and frontend logic

### 3. Backend Architect
- **Role**: Handles server-side development
- **Capabilities**: API design, database modeling, business logic
- **When to use**: Developing backend services and APIs

### 4. Security Analyst
- **Role**: Ensures code security
- **Capabilities**: Vulnerability scanning, security best practices
- **When to use**: Code reviews, security audits

### 5. Performance Optimizer
- **Role**: Improves application performance
- **Capabilities**: Performance analysis, optimization suggestions
- **When to use**: When your application needs performance tuning

### 6. Testing Engineer
- **Role**: Creates and manages tests
- **Capabilities**: Unit tests, integration tests, test coverage
- **When to use**: Setting up testing infrastructure, increasing test coverage

## Using Agents

### Starting an Agent

1. Open the AI Agents panel
2. Select the agent type
3. Define the task or question
4. Click "Start"

### Monitoring Agent Activity

- The dashboard shows active agents and their status
- View detailed logs in the Activity panel
- Monitor resource usage in the Performance tab

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** with your instructions to agents
2. **Break down** complex tasks into smaller ones
3. **Review** agent suggestions before applying them
4. **Use multiple agents** together for complex projects

## Agent Communication

Agents can communicate with each other to solve complex problems. For example:

1. The Orchestrator might delegate tasks to specialized agents
2. The Frontend Expert might consult with the Security Analyst about authentication flows
3. The Testing Engineer might work with the Backend Architect to improve test coverage

## Customizing Agent Behavior

You can customize agent behavior through:

1. **Templates**: Save common agent configurations
2. **Prompts**: Customize the instructions given to agents
3. **Parameters**: Adjust temperature, creativity, and other model parameters

## Troubleshooting

If an agent is not performing as expected:

1. Check the logs for errors
2. Try rephrasing your request
3. Consider using a different agent or combination of agents
4. Report persistent issues to the support team
